Undressin' you with your clothes on,
Standin' up while we're layin' down.
You found a position that turns me on (woo)
Temperature's hotter than fire
And the heat has got me burnin' up
So let's stop, drop and roll together

(When we make
When we make
When we make
When we make
When we make love)
We use our imagination,
And it always feels like the very first time,
When you got your love in between mine
And I'm lovin' it

This is what it feels, This is what it feels like
This is what it tastes, This is what it tastes like (It tastes like)
This is what it looks (Oh, oh), This is what it looks like
This is what it sounds, This is what it sounds like (Every time we're makin' love)
This is what it feels, This is what it feels like
This is what it tastes (Every time, every time), This is what it tastes like (Anytime)
This is what it looks (This is what it sounds like), This is what it looks like
This is what it sounds (Oh), This is what it sounds like
Every time we're making love

Our bodies work like a playground
Slippin' slidin' goin' round and round
And I like this ride
I don't wanna get off
Oh, no, no
And when you kiss my lids
And then you kiss my lips
You got me tremblin'
I'm ready for the perfect hit

(When we make (When we make)
When we make
When we make
When we make
When we make love)
We stay
Creative with it baby all night long
Makin' sure feels like the very first time
When you got your love in between mine

This is what it feels, This is what it feels like (Can you picture that)
This is what it tastes, This is what it tastes like (I want you to know what it feels)
This is what it looks, This is what it looks like (Can you taste it)
This is what it sounds (Can you hear it), This is what it sounds like
This is what it feels (Can you feel), This is what it feels like (Oh, baby)
This is what it tastes, This is what it tastes like (This is what it taste like)
This is what it looks (This what it sounds like), This is what it looks like
This is what it sounds (Oh), This is what it sounds like
Every time we're making love

Feels soft, wet and creamy
Tastes sweeter than honey
Exotic sounds
Cause we're in paradise (o)
Usin' everything
From the top of my hair
Down to my toes
Give you my all
My body, heart and soul (My body, heart and soul)
I'll shower you with my river of love (Yeah, yeah)
It's comin' down (Oh)
I'm about to explode

This is what it feels, This is what it feels like
This is what it tastes (Yeah, yeah), This is what it taste like (Yeah, yeah)
This is what it looks (yeah, yeah), This is what it looks like (Whoa)
This is what it sounds, This is what it sounds like (Ba, ba, ba, babe)

When you lay me down
One liftin' me
Can you hear the sound
Of my body's peak
I wanna go half
Let's make a child
This is what it feels like
Every time we make love

This is what it sounds like (This is what it sounds like)
This is what it taste
This is what it tastes like (Yeah)
This is what it looks
This is what it looks like
This is what it sounds (Mmm mmm)
This is what it sounds like (Oh)
This is what it feels like
This is what it sounds like

Melody fades until end.
